- Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation
- Performance Metrics and Results Interpretation

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the project:

```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
jupyter
```

Install dependencies using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Open the notebook:

```
jupyter notebook olympic_ml.ipynb
```

2. Run the cells step-by-step to analyze data and train models.

## Results

Key insights and predictions will be presented as visualizations and model outputs within the notebook.
