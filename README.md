# Olympic Data Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting trends in Olympic data using machine learning techniques. The notebook explores data preprocessing, visualization, and model building to draw insights and make predictions based on historical Olympic datasets.

## Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Visualizations
- Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation
- Performance Metrics and Results Interpretation

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the project:

```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
jupyter
```

Install dependencies using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## File Structure

- **olympic\_ml.ipynb** - Main notebook containing the code and outputs.
- **data/** - Folder to store datasets.
- **models/** - Folder to save trained models (if applicable).
- **README.md** - Documentation for the project.

## Usage

1. Open the notebook:

```
jupyter notebook olympic_ml.ipynb
```

2. Run the cells step-by-step to analyze data and train models.

## Results

Key insights and predictions will be presented as visualizations and model outputs within the notebook.
